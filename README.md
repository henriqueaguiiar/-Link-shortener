# ðŸ”— Link Shortener

This is a study project built with **TypeScript** and **Node.js** to practice key backend development concepts. It implements a basic link shortener and aims to explore:

* **Data persistence** using local JSON files
* **Asynchronous programming** with `async/await`
* **Object-oriented programming** (OOP)
* **RESTful API** design
* **Automated testing** with Jest

The goal is to provide a simple and functional project structure to reinforce core backend principles without relying on external databases.
